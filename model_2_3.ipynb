beating, the bands playing, the toy\\npistols popping, the bunched firecrackers hissing and sputtering; \\non every hand and far down thereceding\\nand fading spreads of roofs and balconies a fluttering wilderness of flags flashed in thesun; \\ndaily the young volunteers marched down the wide avenue gay and fine in their new\\nuniforms, the proud fathers and mothers and sisters and sweethearts cheering them with voices\\nchoked with happy emotion as they swung by; nightly the packed mass meetings listened,\\npanting, to patriot oratory which stirred the deepest deeps of their hearts and which they\\ninterrupted at briefest intervals with cyclones of applause, the tears running down their cheeks the\\nwhile; in the churches the pastors preached devotion to flag and country and invoked the God of\\nBattles, beseeching His aid in our good cause in outpouring of fervid eloquence which moved\\nevery listener.\\nIt was indeed a glad and gracious time, and the half dozen rash spirits that ventured to\\ndisapprove of the war and cast a doubt upon its righteousness straightway got such a stern and\\nangry warning that for their personal safety's sake they quickly shrank out of sight and offended\\nno more in that way.\\nSunday morning came - next day the battalions would leave for the front; the church was filled;\\nthe volunteers were there, their faces alight with material dreams - visions of a stern advance, the\\ngathering momentum, the rushing charge, the flashing sabers, the flight of the foe, the tumult, the\\nenveloping smoke, the fierce pursuit, the surrender! - then home from the war, bronzed heros,\\nwelcomed, adored, submerged in golden seas of glory! With the volunteers sat their dear ones,\\nproud, happy, and envied by the neighbors and friends who had no sons and brothers to send forth\\nto the field of honor, there to win for the flag or, failing, die the noblest of noble deaths. The\\nservice proceeded; a war chapter from the Old Testament was read; the first prayer was said; it\\nwas followed by an organ burst that shook the building, and with one impulse the house rose,\\nwith glowing eyes and beating hearts, and poured out that tremendous invocation -- 'God the allterrible!' \\nThou who ordainest, Thunder thy clarion and lightning thy sword!'\\nThen came the 'long' prayer. None could remember the like of it for passionate pleading and\\nmoving and beautiful language. The burden of its supplication was that an ever-merciful and\\nbenignant Father of us all would watch over our noble young soldiers and aid, comfort, and\\nencourage them in their patriotic work; bless them, shield them in His mighty hand, make them\\nstrong and confident, invincible in the bloody onset; help them to crush the foe, grant to them and\\nto their flag and country imperishable honor and glory --\\n An aged stranger entered and moved with slow and noiseless step up the main aisle, his eyes\\nfixed upon the minister, his long body clothed in a robe that reached to his feet, his head bare, his\\nwhite hair descending in a frothy cataract to his shoulders, his seamy face unnaturally pale, pale\\neven to ghastliness. With all eyes following him and wondering, he made his silent way; without\\npausing, he ascended to the preacher's side and stood there, waiting.\\nWith shut lids the preacher, unconscious of his presence, continued his moving prayer, and at\\nlast finished it with the words, uttered in fervent appeal,'Bless our arms, grant us the victory, \\nLord our God, Father and Protector of our land and flag!'\\nThe stranger touched his arm, motioned him to step aside - which the startled minister did - and\\ntook his place. During some moments he surveyed the spellbound audience with solemn eyes in\\nwhich burned an uncanny light; then in a deep voice he said\\n'I come from the Throne - bearing a message from Almighty God!' The words smote the\\nhouse with a shock; if the stranger perceived it he gave no attention. 'He has heard the prayer of\\nHis servant your shepherd and grant it if such shall be your desire after I, His messenger, shall\\nhave explained to you its import - that is to say, its full import. For it is like unto many of the\\nprayers of men, in that it asks for more than he who utters it is aware of - except he pause and\\nthink.\\n'God's servant and yours has prayed his prayer. Has he paused and taken thought? Is it one\\nprayer? No, it is two - one uttered, the other not. Both have reached the ear of His Who heareth\\nall supplications, the spoken and the unspoken. Ponder this - keep it in mind. If you beseech a\\nblessing upon yourself, beware! lest without intent you invoke a curse upon a neighbor at the\\nsame time. If you pray for the blessing of rain upon your crop which needs it, by that act you are\\npossibly praying for a curse upon some neighbor's crop which may not need rain and can be\\ninjured by it.\\n'You have heard your servant's prayer - the uttered part of it. I am commissioned by God to put\\ninto words the other part of it - that part which the pastor, and also you in your hearts, fervently\\nprayed silently. And ignorantly and unthinkingly? God grant that it was so! You heard these\\nwords: 'Grant us the victory, O Lord our God!' That is sufficient. The whole of the uttered prayer\\nis compact into those pregnant words. Elaborations were not necessary. When you have prayed\\nfor victory you have prayed for many unmentioned results which follow victory - must follow it,\\ncannot help but follow it. Upon the listening spirit of God the Father fell also the unspoken part of\\nthe prayer. He commandeth me to put it into words.\\nListen!\\n 'O Lord our Father, our young patriots, idols of our hearts, go forth to battle –\\nbe Thou near them! With them, in spirit, we also go forth from the sweet peace of our beloved\\nfiresides to smite the foe. O Lord our God,\\nhelp us to tear their soldiers to bloody shreds with our shells;\\nhelp us to cover their smiling fields with the pale forms of their patriot dead;\\nhelp us to drown the thunder of the guns with the shrieks of their wounded, writhing in pain;\\nhelp us to lay waste their humble homes with a hurricane of fire;\\nhelp us to wring the hearts of their unoffending widows with unavailing grief;\\nhelp us to turn them out roofless with their little children to wander unfriended the wastes of their\\ndesolated land in rags and hunger and thirst, sports of the sun flames of summer and the icy winds\\nof winter, broken in spirit, worn with travail, imploring Thee for the refuge of the grave and\\ndenied it -\\nfor our sakes who adore Thee, Lord,\\nblast their hopes,\\nblight their lives,\\nprotract their bitter pilgrimage,\\nmake heavy their steps,\\nwater their way with their tears,\\nstain the white snow with the blood of their wounded feet!\\nWe ask it, in the spirit of love, of Him Who is the Source of Love, and Who is ever - faithful\\nrefuge and friend of all that are sore beset and seek His aid with humble and contrite hearts.\\nAmen.'\\n(After a pause)\\n'Ye have prayed it; if ye still desire it, speak!
